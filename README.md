# SanfordYatesBarometer
Data from the Barometer of Phypox going down the elevator in Sanford Underground Lab

Pressure in hPA
Time in Seconds
Foreword to teachers

Consider using this notebook after the student has some experience with Google Colab, Python and Graphs.

# Implementation plan

## Before

* Prepare students for the use of Google Colab notebooks
* Use a scafolding methodology using notebooks of increasing complexity.
* Loading data into Google Colab
* Formulas and expressions
* Graphs and Plotting
* Discuss Pressure, Barometers
* Kinematics Unit
* Movement
* Graphs of motion
* Acceleration
* Discuss Phypox sensors

## During

*   Use this activity to introduce neutrinos and DUNE
* Show pictures of the site and diagrams
* Discuss objectives
* Review concepts:
  * average velocity
  * acceleration
  * graphs of motion
* Have students run the notebook
* Students discuss result in small groups
* Students submit indivual reports with answers

## After

Discuss limitations/improvements of the data
Have students suggest similar projects
Encourage students to learn about DUNE and neutrinos.

## PR DE Standards and Curriculum
### Unit F.1 Science and Engineering practices

**ES.F.IT1.1** Identifies real life situations where physics can be applied to explain/understand the behavior of matter and how the universe works

**ES.F.IT1.2** The student uses the International System of Units and scientific notation to make conversions between units and expresses them with the correct number of significant digits as well as solving physics equations for unknowns.

**ES.F.IT1.3** Represents and calculates the magnitude and direction of vectorial quantities by graphical methods as well as mathematical methods [...]

### Unit F.2 Movement (Kinematics)

**ES.F1.1** Uses models to explain movement in one dimension, through verbal, graphical and algebraic methods including concepts such as distance, displacement, speed, velocity and acceleration.

## NGSS Standard
**HS-PS2-1** Analyze data to support the claim that Newtonâ€™s second law of motion describes the mathematical relationship among the net force on a macroscopic object, its mass, and its acceleration. [Clarification Statement: Examples of data could include tables or graphs of position or velocity as a function of time for objects subject to a net unbalanced force, such as a falling object, an object sliding down a ramp, or a moving object being pulled by a constant force.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment is limited to one-dimensional motion and to macroscopic objects moving at non-relativistic speeds.]
